file1) implementing greyscale via desaturation,median cut,octree.
file2) Implement k-means clustering-based rate distortion quatization for the images
file3Frequency sampling: convert to greyscale, then sample frequency bands at 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16; Spatial sampling: downsample image resolution by factors 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16.
